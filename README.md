A Dictionary-Based Fuzzy Search and Spell Correction Engine for Smart Shopping

Problem Statement:
Online shopping platforms rely heavily on search boxes to help customers find products, but customers frequently misspell item names while typing, causing traditional exact-match search to return no results. This project builds a console-based smart shopping search engine that tolerates spelling mistakes, auto-corrects them, and helps customers discover, filter, and purchase products efficiently.

Features:
1.Spell-corrected item search ("Did you mean...?") - Trie + Levenshtein Edit Distance (Dynamic Programming)
2.Autocomplete while typing                        - Trie prefix traversal
3.Keyword / substring search	                   - Rabin-Karp rolling hash
4.Category-wise browsing	                   - HashMap grouping
5.Price-range search	                           - Binary Search (on a price-sorted list)
6.Top-N cheapest / most expensive items            - Priority Queue (Heap)
7.Shopping cart with running total	           - HashMap
8.Trending searches	                           - HashMap frequency counter
9.Catalog structure visualization	           - Trie traversal / printing

How to Run:
Requires JDK 11 or later

# Compile
javac *.java

# Run
java Main products.csv

You'll see a menu:
1.  Search for an item (with spell correction)
2.  Browse all items
3.  Browse items by category
4.  Autocomplete (type a prefix)
5.  Keyword / substring search
6.  Trending searches
7.  Search by price range (Binary Search)
8.  Top-N cheapest / most expensive (Heap)
9.  Shopping cart
10. View catalog structure (Trie)
11. Exit

Example: Spell correction
Choose an option: 1
Enter item name: shooz

Did you mean: "shoes"?

Item found:
  Name        : Shoes
  Category    : Footwear
  Price       : Rs. 1299.00
  Description : Shoes - a reliable footwear product for everyday use.

How It Works

Fuzzy search / spell correction: Product names are indexed in a Trie, where each node represents one character and shared prefixes (e.g. "car", "care", "career") share the same path. When a query is misspelled, the engine performs a depth-first traversal of the Trie, computing one row of the Levenshtein edit-distance DP table per character — reusing shared-prefix computation and pruning branches that can no longer produce a valid match (branch-and-bound). The maximum allowed edit distance scales with query length (2 for short words, up to 4 for long words), so longer words aren't unfairly penalized for having more room for typos.

Autocomplete: Reuses the same Trie — walking to the prefix's node once, then collecting every word stored beneath it.

Substring/keyword search: Uses Rabin-Karp's rolling hash to check whether a keyword appears anywhere inside each product name, in average O(n) time per word instead of a naive character-by-character scan.

Price-range search: Products are sorted once by price, then binary search finds the lower and upper bounds of the requested range in O(log n) instead of scanning the whole catalog.

Top-N cheapest/most expensive: Uses a PriorityQueue as a bounded heap of size N, giving O(P log N) performance instead of sorting the entire catalog.

Shopping cart & trending searches: Both use a HashMap for O(1) add/update/lookup — the cart maps product name to quantity, and the search-history tracker maps search term to frequency count.
